# 👜 Namma Wallet

**Namma Wallet** is an open-source application that lets you **save, organize, and view your tickets** — from SETC and bus tickets to train tickets or any other type of pass. The app parses ticket data and generates a **beautiful digital ticket design** right inside the app.

Unlike Apple Wallet or Google Wallet, which support only specific formats, **Namma Wallet** is a flexible, community-driven solution for tickets, passes, and more.

Do you want me to also design a **project logo / banner** (like a minimal wallet + ticket icon) so your README looks more professional on GitHub?
